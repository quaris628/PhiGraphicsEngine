MAJOR:
create unit tests
add config file for keybinds
add mouse event features
optimize keyDownEvent into "subscribe for when this key is pressed" system?

MINOR:
make default renderer background image not need a file
Change Renderer from singleton to attached to a certain image output ( Renderer(image) )
bug? a single keypress is sometimes interpreted as multiple KeyDown events
