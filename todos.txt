Vector and Vector test

MAJOR:
write tests (unit, regression...)
add config file for keybinds
add mouse event features
optimize keyDownEvent into "subscribe for when this key is pressed" system?

MINOR:
make default renderer background image not need a file? (maybe not possible/feasible)
add overload-esque displace methods to Movable2D
Make 1 Renderer : 1 Scene (?)
bug? a single keypress is sometimes interpreted as multiple KeyDown events
bug - Renderer center functionality not updated on scene switch
~optimize renderer.Render()?
