MAJOR:
write tests (unit, regression...)
add config file for keybinds
add mouse event features
optimize keyDownEvent into "subscribe for when this key is pressed" system?

MINOR:
make default renderer background image not need a file? (maybe not possible/feasible)
bug? a single keypress is sometimes interpreted as multiple KeyDown events
~optimize renderer.Render()?
