MAJOR:
write tests (unit, regression...)
add config file for keybinds
add mouse event features

MINOR:
Vector and Vector test
make default renderer background image not need a file? (maybe not possible/feasible)
add overload-esque displace methods to Movable2D
Make 1 Renderer : 1 Scene (?), saves some setup/takedown processing for scene switches, costs some extra memory (?)
bug? a single keypress is sometimes interpreted as multiple KeyDown events
bug - Renderer center functionality not updated on scene switch
quasi-optimize renderer.Render() as described in its comments?
