MAJOR:
make scene switches not lose memory references -- do with previousScene reference in each scene?
create unit tests
add config file for keybinds
add mouse event features

MINOR:
optimize keyDownEvent into "subscribe for when this key is pressed" system?
make default renderer background image not need a file
Change Renderer from singleton to attached to a certain picturebox/image output ( Renderer(picturebox/image), set/get picturebox/image )
demo more features in example project (e.g. animation w/ timer)
