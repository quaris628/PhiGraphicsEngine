Changes from phi's usage in Ukulele Hero:
- moved all phi classes to /phi folder
- renamed PlayableGameView to IScene
- renamed Form1 to WindowsForm
- renamed Program to PhiMain
- added Scene, an abstract class with some default methods that implements IScene
- refactored scene switching in the Form to one private method
